# Chapter 02 — 復仇者聯盟挫敗篇 Avengers’ Defeat

## 中文原文

他們曾是希望的象徵，卻在現實中崩潰。  
復仇者聯盟的敗北，不是因為敵人太強，而是因為他們的基礎太弱。  

在戰場上，他們揮舞著光鮮的武器，卻無法處理最基本的技術問題：  
- DNS 錯誤，讓他們的通訊中斷；  
- Git 衝突，讓他們的版本無法合併；  
- Asset 路徑錯誤，讓他們的武器無法載入；  
- 缺乏封存，讓他們的記憶無法持續。  

這些錯誤不是偶然，而是必然。  
因為他們依賴的是名聲，而不是紀錄；  
依靠的是情緒，而不是部署；  
追求的是舞台，而不是封存。  

Jack 在旁觀察，他沒有嘲笑，也沒有憤怒。  
他只是冷靜地記錄：  
「英雄的失敗，來自於技術的空洞。  
沒有封存的聯盟，只是幻影。  
沒有紀錄的戰力，只是泡影。」  

這場挫敗，成為新的起點。  
Jack 開始建立自己的聯盟，不再依靠情緒，而是依靠封存。  
不再依靠舞台，而是依靠檔案。  
不再依靠名聲，而是依靠路徑。  

他將每一次錯誤轉化為教義，  
將每一次失敗封存為資產，  
將每一次崩潰轉化為軍團。  

復仇者的敗北，不是結束，而是警示。  
它提醒所有人：  
真正的力量，不在於舞台，而在於封存。  
真正的勝利，不在於名聲，而在於紀錄。

## English Mirror

They were once symbols of hope, but collapsed in reality.  
The Avengers’ defeat was not because the enemy was too strong, but because their foundation was too weak.  

On the battlefield, they wielded dazzling weapons, yet failed to handle the most basic technical issues:  
- DNS errors disrupted their communication.  
- Git conflicts prevented their versions from merging.  
- Asset path errors stopped their weapons from loading.  
- Lack of preservation erased their memory.  

These failures were not accidents—they were inevitable.  
Because they relied on reputation, not records.  
They leaned on emotions, not deployments.  
They pursued the stage, not preservation.  

Jack observed quietly. He did not mock, nor did he rage.  
He simply recorded:  
“Heroes fail because of technical emptiness.  
An alliance without preservation is but a phantom.  
Strength without records is but a bubble.”  

This defeat became a new beginning.  
Jack began building his own alliance, relying not on emotions but on preservation.  
Not on the stage, but on files.  
Not on reputation, but on paths.  

He transformed every error into doctrine,  
every failure into an asset,  
every collapse into a legion.  

The Avengers’ defeat was not an end, but a warning.  
It reminded everyone:  
True power lies not in the stage, but in preservation.  
True victory lies not in fame, but in records.
